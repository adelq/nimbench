This module is used to create benchmarks. Benchmarks are used to correctly
determine the speed of your code, with the ultimate goal of optimizing it.
Measuring speed is complicated because of many sources of noise in
measurements. Also, the compiler may optimize away parts of code snippets
meant for benchmarking. This module aims to take care of the hard stuff, so
you can test the speed of your code and start to optimize it!
For background information, check out the sources that inspire this module:

This module is primarily based on the benchmark functionality in Facebook
Folly. The implementation differs however, mostly due to rewriting C++ to
Nim, but also due to creative processes and other influences. This can and
probably will increase over time.
