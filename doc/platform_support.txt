Some details in this module are heavily OS, compiler or even platform
dependent. These include:
- High precision time measurement procedures
- The procedures that trick the compiler optimizer doNotOptimizeAway() and
  memoryClobber()
This module has been tested on:
- Windows 10 / x86-64 with compilers:
  - MSVC distributed with Visual Studio 2013 (also called vcc sometimes)
  - Mingw compiler distributed with Nim Version 0.13.0
- Ubuntu 15.10 / x86 (in a VM) with compilers:
  - clang 3.6.2
  - gcc 5.2.1
Community members tested and reported that nimbench also works on:
- Ubuntu 15.10 / x86-64
- Macosx
- Details about compilers / version numbers are unfortunately not reported, feel
  free to add them when you test your specific platform.

Porting to other platforms is not too much work, but it must be done
correctly. This means that the resulting assembly code must be checked, to
determine for example if the doNotOptimizeAway() works and does not generate
unnecessary overhead.

Everyone is welcome to help / contribute with the porting job. Inspiration
can be found on many sources on the internet, some of which are listed in the
introduction.
